# Predictions_and_Predictability

Git Repository for the Predictions and Predictability Class by Leonard Borchert and Christopher Kadow at UHH in 2023/24.

Our Group is the Movement Group:
We are predicting the number of the Cyclones in the Tropical Atlantic per year, using the HURDAT2 observation dataset from the the US' National Hurricane Center. 
Maybe we will additionally look into ocean surface waves or into a path of the cyclones/most cyclone genesis density.

The functions for the predictions can be found in *prediction_functions.py*
The comments and Docstrings are generated by Chatgpt, but checked afterwards again, this only serves the purpose of better understanding the code.
